## About Me

Hi! I'm a 4th year UBC student studying business and computer science, and currently working as an assistant with the Hippy Research Lab at BC Children's Hospital. My strengths lie at the intersection of data analysis and business thinking. Having one year of full time experience working at BC Children's Hospital, I am passionate about using technology to create value in the field of healthcare. I am open-minded, reflective, and eager to learn!


## Data Analysis Samples

In 2021, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant to professor Arslan Aziz at UBC Sauder School of Business. Below are a few samples of my work. I mainly used R to create visualizations which helped to clearly and effectively communicate findings from experiment data.
