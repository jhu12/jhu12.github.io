# Hi! My name is Jack, I am a 4th year UBC student studying business and computer science.


## Research Work

Since May 2021, I have been working as an undergreaduate research assistant to professor Arslan Aziz at UBC Sauder School of Business. Below are a few samples of my contribution to his work. I have been using R to create visualizations which help to clearly and effectively communicate findings from the experiment data.
