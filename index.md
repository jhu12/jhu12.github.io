Welcome to my page!

### How Git works:

Git is a version control system. This means that it will keep the best, working version of a project on 'main', and you can create a 'branch' to develop or experiment, then merge it back to the main branch when the work is ready. This ensures that there is always the 'good' version and the changes you make must be approved before put into place. You can also make experimental versions to test what works better.

To work on a project on your own machine, you "clone" the repository. When you make changes, you first "commit" them as a version (local), and then "push" the changes to the repository (remote). When the changes have been reviewed, they are then "merged" with other branches or the main branch. The main branch is the end product, so it must always be working code. When you need the latest version of the project on your machine so that it includes everyone else's work, you "pull". A pull request is something to let collaborators know about the changes you made.

For Github pages, we can easily edit markdown files on the github editor online so we may not need to use cloning, push, pull. Unless you wish to manage different versions, we won't need branching or merging either. You can make changes to files in Github's online editor and commit the changes directly on the main branch.


### Steps to creating an amazing page just like mine:

Create a new **public** repository, it must have the name *username*.github.io.

Choose a publishing source: Go to the repository settings, then click the Pages tab on the left. Under *Source* select *main* branch.
