# Hi, I'm Jack!

I'm a 4th year UBC student studying business and computer science. I am currently searching for a 4 or 8 month co-op job to start in January 2022.


## Research Work

Since May 2021, I have been working as an undergraduate research assistant to professor Arslan Aziz at UBC Sauder School of Business. Below are a few samples of my work. I have been using R to create visualizations which help to clearly and effectively communicate findings from the experiment data.
