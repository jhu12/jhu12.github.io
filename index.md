## About Me

Hi! I'm a 4th year UBC student studying business and computer science, and currently searching for a 4 or 8 month co-op job to start in January 2022. My strengths lie at the intersection of data analysis and business thinking, and I'm passionate about using technology to create value. I am open-minded, reflective, and eager to learn!


## Research Work

Since May 2021, I have been working as an undergraduate research assistant to professor Arslan Aziz at UBC Sauder School of Business. Below are a few samples of my work. I have been using R to create visualizations which help to clearly and effectively communicate findings from the experiment data.
