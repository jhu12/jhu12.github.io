Here are some of the steps to create a Github Pages website.


1. Create a new **public** repository, it must have the name *username*.github.io.

2. Choose a publishing source: Go to the repository settings, then click the Pages tab on the left. Under *Source* select *main* branch.

3. Create an index.md or index.html file. This is the page found at *username*.github.io.

4. Add other .md or .html files. They will be published at links under the same path as they are placed in the repository.

Here is the [documentation for Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
